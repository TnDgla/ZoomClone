Investigating issue #2 - "Attempted to load @next/swc-win32-x64-msvc" error:

1. Verified package.json and package-lock.json for swc dependencies:
   - No direct dependencies on @next/swc-win32-x64-msvc found.
   - Next.js version: 14.1.3 (which includes SWC by default)

2. Node.js and npm versions:
   - Recommended: Node.js >= 18.17.0
   - Current project setup uses appropriate versions

3. Compatibility issues:
   - Error suggests Windows x64 architecture
   - Project may be running on a different OS or architecture

4. Potential solutions:
   a. Ensure development is done on Windows x64 system
   b. If cross-platform development:
      - Use cross-platform compatible Next.js features
      - Consider using WSL2 for Linux-like environment on Windows

5. Next steps:
   - Verify development environment matches target deployment environment
   - Run `npm cache clean --force` and reinstall dependencies
   - If issue persists, consider creating a minimal reproduction and reporting to Next.js repository

6. Documentation and resources:
   - Next.js documentation on SWC: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/compiler
   - GitHub issue for similar problems: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/32252

Updates and results will be documented here as investigation progresses.
